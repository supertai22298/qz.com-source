/**
 * WARNING for those editing this file:
 * ------------------------------------
 * This file governs the URL structure of qz.com. Adding new routes is generally
 * safe, but editing existing routes should be done with care. Please make sure
 * your changes are communicated to the entire engineering team, but especially
 * to engineers working on the iOS and Android app. Some URLs are hardcoded into
 * the app and may need to be updated.
 *
 * Additionally, please consider adding a 301 redirect from the old URL to the
 * new one.
 *
 * ============
 * REMEMBER TO:
 * ============
 *
 * 1. Use a trailing slash in the componentâ€™s `canonicalPath` if the URL has a
 *    trailing slash (and it probably should).
 *
 * 2. Double-backslash inside template literals and single quotes, but not
 *    inside double quotes (JSX voodoo):
 *      path={`/:id(\\d+)`}
 *      path="/:id(\d+)"
 *
 * 3. Keep the routes in alphabetical order by component name.
 *
 * 4. ... except for NotFound. That must go last, as a catch-all.
